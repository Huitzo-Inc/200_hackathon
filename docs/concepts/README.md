# Concepts

This section covers the foundational "why" and "how" of Huitzo: why the platform exists, how to think about building with it, and what infrastructure it handles for you.

Read these docs before touching the SDK or CLI. They explain the problem Huitzo solves, the building methodology it enforces, and the complete production infrastructure it provides.

## Core Concepts

| Document | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **[Why Huitzo](why-huitzo.md)** | The infrastructure gap between AI models and production systems |
| **[Building Methodology](building-methodology.md)** | Commands, not applications: decomposing problems into focused units |
| **[From Model to Production](from-model-to-production.md)** | The complete infrastructure layer Huitzo handles automatically |
